description: Disco Elysium understands the draw and the danger of the past unlike any other piece of media I've seen.

The past is dangerous. Left unchecked, what starts as wistful nostalgia can quickly become an all-consuming vortex, whirling regret and the death of your ability to grow and change. Some of my favorite books and films are about memory and the past; indeed, my favorite movie of all time is *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind* which centers entirely around the question of how much painful memories can haunt us, and what of ourselves we lose should we try to give those memories away. But in this topic, standing head and shoulders above the rest, is ZA/UM's masterpiece of a game, Disco Elysium.

First, some quick acknowledgements: this post owes a lot to [The Weight of the Past in Disco Elysium](https://web.archive.org/web/20210618152016/https://www.thefandomentals.com/past-disco-elysium/) by Micha≈Ç at Fandomentals, although I hope to add my own analysis here. I should also note that I won't be marking spoilers in this post, and it assumes some level of familiarity with the game. 

Disco Elysium understands the past. It understands its cloying draw and its venomous threat. The past is everywhere in Disco Elysium. It is what the protagonist attempted to obliterate on his world-ending bender just before the opening of the game; it haunts the district of Martinaise, where the physical scars of a violent past constantly present themselves and the inhabitants are unable to escape it; it is *literally* a world-ending force.

*There is nothing. Only warm, primordial blackness.*

Our protagonist, Harrier Du Bois, is not a very happy man. The game opens to him waking up naked on the floor after a multi-day alcohol and drug filled bender in which he attempted to totally annihilate his memory. Harry's past was so painful to him that he would rather eliminate it entirely, shouting into the night before blacking out: "I don't want to be this kind of animal anymore."

Throughout the game, we learn piecemeal the trauma that Harry was trying to escape.

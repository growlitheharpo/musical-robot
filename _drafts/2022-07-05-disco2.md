description: Disco Elysium understands the draw and the danger of the past unlike any other piece of media I've seen.
---

The past is dangerous. Left unchecked, what starts as wistful nostalgia can quickly become an all-consuming vortex, whirling regret and the death of your ability to grow and change. Some of my favorite books and films are about memory and the past; indeed, my favorite movie of all time is *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind* which centers entirely around the question of how much painful memories can haunt us, and what of ourselves we lose should we try to give those memories away. But in this topic, standing head and shoulders above the rest, is ZA/UM's masterpiece of a game, Disco Elysium.

First, some quick acknowledgements: this post owes a lot to [The Weight of the Past in Disco Elysium](https://web.archive.org/web/20210618152016/https://www.thefandomentals.com/past-disco-elysium/) by Micha≈Ç at Fandomentals, although I hope to add my own analysis here. I should also note that I won't be marking spoilers in this post, and it assumes some level of familiarity with the game. 

Disco Elysium understands the past. It understands its cloying draw and its venomous threat. The past is everywhere in Disco Elysium. It is what the protagonist attempted to obliterate on his world-ending bender just before the opening of the game; it haunts the district of Martinaise, where the physical scars of a violent past constantly present themselves and the inhabitants are unable to escape it; it is *literally* a world-ending force.

# The Detective

*There is nothing. Only warm, primordial blackness.*

Our protagonist, Harrier Du Bois, is not a very happy man. The game opens to him waking up naked on the floor after a multi-day alcohol and drug filled bender in which he attempted to totally annihilate his memory. Harry's past was so painful to him that he would rather eliminate it entirely, shouting into the night before blacking out: "I don't want to be this kind of animal anymore."

Throughout the game, we learn piecemeal the trauma that Harry was trying to escape. His main ghost, the core event which has pushed him into this utter despair, is a breakup which occurred roughly six years ago at the time of the game. As Harry is a bit of an unreliable narrator, it's hard to be totally certain what happened - though perhaps for the purposes of a discussion on memory, that's appropriate. The story we get is that Harry and Dora met, fell in love, moved into a small house on Voyager Road together. At the time, Harry was a gym teacher, but Dora inspired him to do something more with his life and so he joined the RCM to become a detective. Over the course of the next decade or so, Harry became progressively more traumatized by his work on the force, leading to his alcoholism and the slow fizzling and fading of their love. It's possible that somewhere during this time, Dora became pregnant but decided (either together or on her own) to terminate it. In the end she left him, flying halfway across the world to get as far away from her old life as possible.

Harry's memory of this relationship and its end seeps into every skill, every aspect of his personality. They all miss her, or hate her, or both. Finding a note in your police paperwork written by her causes Harry to pass out on the spot as the memories come rushing back. In his mind, Harry has conflated Dora with an in-universe messianic figure, Dolores Dei, who is said to be so perfect she may not even be human. In a recurring dream, implied to happen nearly every night before he obliterated his memory but which only occurs once in the game, Harry relives the final conversation he had with Dora as she left, leaving him alone in front of the video rental store - except she has now become a god-like figure of perfection.

The game drives home the damage that this has done to Harry by ensuring you never get too far away from it. Reminders of Dora can be found in every location and pop up in unexpected turns in conversations. A chewing gum wrapper found in the pocket of a random pair of pants reminds you of her kiss the night you met her parents. The aforementioned note causes you to spiral into despair when you thought you were just browsing old case files. Finding a Dolorian Church causes the associations in your mangled brain to fire when you see the giant stained glass portrait of Dolores Dei with her glowing lungs.

In one of the most funny, most tragic moments in the game, Harry can choose to go up to a payphone in a desolate area along the coast by an abandoned boardwalk and start dialing random numbers. At first, it is just a series of amusing "prank" calls. A handful of throwaway gags. Then, with no real warning, your fingers begin flying across the keypad, moving on their own. They dial a huge long-distance number. Harry, like the player, seemingly has no idea where the number is even coming from - he just knows it. 

Of course, the number is Dora's, and what follows is heartbreaking in its simplicity. It's the middle of the night where she is, and when she groggily answers the phone Harry's heart nearly stops - as did mine, when I was playing - as he realizes whose voice he just heard. In a subtle animation, immediately after her "Hello?", Harry doubles over slightly, his pain at the sound of her voice turned physical. He attempts to have a conversation with her; the exact contents of which depend on the player's choice but largely ends up being mostly mundane, until she either hangs up or the machine runs out of money. Either way, there is no reward, no payoff, certainly no closure. The conversation just leaves Harry as broken and sad as he was before, as unable to let go of the past.

# The City

In Disco Elysium, the setting is practically a character unto itself. If you've never played, it is hard to emphasize enough just how realized Revachol is as a place. Primarily through the Shivers and Encyclopedia skill, but also through regular conversations with other characters, the player can be provided with an almost overwhelming amount of information about the district of Martinaise, the city it sits within, and the world they're both on. Shivers sells the *feel* of the city; it is your mind's eye conjuring visions of the streets you have sent your entire life in. Encyclopedia reminds you of the rich history, on the small scale and large, that resulted in the present situation.

The briefest possible summary of the history of Revachol is this: it was founded around 400 years ago by colonizers; it gained its independence, becoming a Suzerainty, and became a colonizer itself. It experienced a "Golden Age," becoming the "Capital of the World." Naturally, it fell into a decline from there, and the Suzerain was overthrown explosively in the Revolution, wherein the Communards seized control. The Commune of Revachol lasted only a few short years before an international coalition landed, slaughtered tens of millions, and instituted their own "provisional" rule. At the time of the game, Revachol has lived in limbo for nearly 50 years, with no self-determination, no government of its own, and no real future to speak of.

Martinaise distills this even further. This is the part of the city where the coalition forces landed to crush the revolution. In a cruel, symbolic gesture, it was never rebuilt. They purposefully left it desolate, bullet-marked, poverty-striken. They purposefully left the artillery craters and the half-demolished buildings. They did this as a warning to any who would again oppose the forces of international capital.

The inhabitants of the district of Martinaise are forced to live in this shadow. Their daily lives are a reminder of a group of people trying to improve the world and failing violently, fatally. At the center of the district stands a ruined statue of one of the last Suzerains, that failed ruling class, surrounded by crumbling buildings and economic devastation. As Kim says, every form of government, every ideology has failed Martinaise has left it at a standstill.

I won't rehash my previous post on the [politics in Disco Elysium](2022-04-10-disco) but suffice to say this richly detailed history is the powerhouse behind the realistic, engrossing political battles that this world contains. In an effective symbiosis, the politics are shown to fuel the history and the history drives the politics. The old inequalities are persistently shown to still be present, the sheer power of those at the top is shown to still be untouchable, the desire for a better world is constantly justified, and the failures of those striving for it are understandable.

Like Harry's past, the game never lets the player forget the past of Revachol and Martinaise. It is built into the environment. Harry is constantly noticing bullet holes in the concrete; you find revolutionary weapon caches and have flashbacks to mass executions as the Revolution came to an end. The Shivers skill interjects frequently in your conversations with the memory and spirit of the city itself, wounded and unable to heal.


# The Pale

One of the most intriguing aspects of the world of Disco Elysium, the point at which it slips ever so slightly into fantasy, or perhaps science fiction, is The Pale. We are never fully told what exactly The Pale is. Indeed, the characters in the world don't seem to have a full understanding of it yet. But the glimpses we get are fascinating.

In one aspect, The Pale is nothingness. It has no taste, no smell, no substance - it is the absence of anything. In our world, the continents are separated by oceans. In the world of Disco Elysium, the oceans are separated by The Pale. Joyce speaks as if the world has shattered, been broken up, is ruptured by Pale. It also appears to be spreading, consuming more and more of the material world - the somethingness - year by year. Worse yet, it is not content merely to consume the periphery. There are small seeds of The Pale, holes in the world, that are present on dry land. You can find one inside of the Dolorian Church on the coast.

There are those in the world who traverse The Pale, hauling cargo between the Isolas for example. We meet one such character, known only as The Paledriver. She gives us our first hint that The Pale too is linked somehow with memory.

She is presented to us as insane. The detective at first thinks she may be on drugs. Her mind drifts between her own memories and those of others. She recounts childhood stories from multiple childhoods. She vividly recalls places she has never been, sights she has never seen, scents she has never smelled. We learn that she has absorbed these from her trips in The Pale. Joyce tells us that exposure to The Pale is dangerous, and those in power have strict limits on annual "doses" of Pale. She has special permission to exceed this because of the importance of her job. In yet another socioeconomic tie-in, The Paledriver is implied to have to go hundreds or even thousands of times over this limit in order to keep her job and make ends meet.

At the end of the game, the conversation with the Phasmid provides a possible explanation for The Paledriver's condition: that The Pale **is** memory. It is rarefied memory, a destructive, deadly force created and fueled by mankind's obsession with the past, its inability to let go. The Pale is consuming the world just as man is consumed by his memory.

# The Whole

Disco Elysium's true genius lies in the way it is able to synthesize all of these threads into a coherent whole. The game's central theme is the danger of clinging to the past. It weaves this into its characters, its politics,

Recently I've been thinking about sexuality and gender and what the label "bisexual" means, at least to me.

<!--more-->

Gender identity and gender expression are a spectrum. This is not up for debate. The claim there are only two genders (or only two sexes) is incorrect and demonstrably false. Because of this, some folks feel some discomfort around the label bisexual. Many of these people prefer pansexual or another similar term instead, but to me this means something different.

*For the most part*, gender expression is classified in a range between masculinity and femininity. If you're reading this, you probably already know that gender is expressed in countless ways, big and small. Clothes, makeup, how you carry your body, how you affect your voice, your pronoun choice, your hairstyle, and far more. For example, in the Western world, wearing clothes that highlight your shoulders moves your expression towards the masculine end, while clothes that highlight your hips move you towards the feminine end. Taken together, all of these pieces add up to an individual's gender expression as a whole, which would fall somewhere along the spectrum.

Even this is a reductionist take (and I apologize for using stereotypical colors to represent this), skipping over gender identity entirely, but we have to start *somewhere*. 

If were to map a gay man's (or straight woman's) attraction against gender expression, it could maybe look something like this:

Of course, everyone is different, and again the threat of reductionism hangs over us. A man who identifies as gay could absolutely be attracted to men who express themselves in a more feminine way. In that case, their "map" would not look like this, and that is perfectly valid. Perhaps that map would have a longer "tail" or the peak would be placed further towards the feminine end. Alternatively, someone may find they are only attracted to very masculine men, in which case it may have a shorter "tail". But still, it is pretty likely that if they identify their own attraction as gay, the majority of the curve would lie on the same half of the spectrum where they feel they are located.

When I think of pansexuality, it would look more like this.

Pansexuality is typically defined as sexuality which is not affected by gender identity, expression, or sex. To folks who identify as pan, it is simply not a factor. They are equally able to be attracted to anyone regardless of where their expression falls along this spectrum.

On that note, attraction for me has pretty much nothing to do with identity, only expression. These are separate axes of who a person is (although for many folks they trend together - but others have written about this better and more extensively than I can here). I find that romantic feelings are more closely linked with identity, while attraction is linked with expression (as I mentioned earlier). To that end, I would identify myself as pan-romantic; someone's identity as a woman, man, non-binary, etc has no impact for me on whether or not I could fall in love with them, but how they express their gender *does* impact whether I will be *attracted* to them which is why I don't identify as pansexual.

So what about bisexuality? To me, and for the purposes of how I identify with the term, it is defined by two things: your map covers both femininity and masculinity like pansexuality does, but it also has peak(s) and trough(s). If I were to map my own attraction, it would probably look something like this.

For me *personally*, I am mostly attracted to feminine expression and more androgynous masculine expression, but I am not attracted to very masculine or very androgynous expression, with very few exceptions. **To be clear**: my sexual attraction or lack thereof has absolutely nothing to do with the validity of someone's identity or expression. It doesn't mean that I don't find aesthetic beauty in all sorts of people, and it also has nothing to do with whether folks are cis or trans. It is strange to me when people imply (or say outright) something to the contrary, that somehow a sexuality that looks like this fails to affirm nonbinary folks (or androgynous expression). But I don't see anyone out here saying that gay men are failing to be inclusive towards women, and this is effectively the same thing. Who you are attracted to really has nothing to do with your ability to be respectful and inclusive; the *only* thing your sexuality defines is who you are sexually attracted to.

But there is still the actual term **bi**sexuality. My personal attraction map has two peaks, but it could just as easily have looked like this:

Or like this:

![](/assets/img/bisexuality-1/6.svg){: .center-image }

Or anything number of possible shapes. And someone who identified with those levels of attraction would be perfectly valid in identifying as bisexual. I think the key lies in the other half of the definition; bisexuality to me means the presence of some attraction, no matter how large or small, on both of the two "halves" of this **continuous** expression spectrum. It does not mean there are merely two genders or two distinct expressions to be attracted to.

In case you didn't notice, I have sprinkled plenty of "to me"s, "I think"s, and "for me"s throughout this post. Sexuality and gender are deeply complex and there is no single right answer for many of these topics, topics which relate so closely to individual human experience. Let this serve as one last disclaimer; this post is just me trying to get my own thoughts and feelings down, not an attempt to be prescriptivist. You may read this and identify with what I said, or you may not. Mostly, I wanted to visualize this aspect of myself through the above "map" and share it; it helps to make otherwise very ethereal feelings concrete, and it felt important, somehow. Perhaps it will be helpful to someone else!

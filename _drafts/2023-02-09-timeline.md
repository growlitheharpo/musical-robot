cw: discussion of suicide, eating disorders, gender dysphoria

This is my best attempt at piecing things together; because of how memory works, things which are more recent are more detailed.

Elementary school, 2002-2007, 

Hating how skinny my legs were, especially my knees.

2015-2018 (college) - hating my chest hair, finding it deeply unattractive; rationalized away by "that just being my taste in boys," since every boy I'd had a crush on or found attractive was a smooth skinny twink and wasn't it normal to just want to be a way that you found attractive?

December 2018 - laying in my partner's childhood bedroom one morning a few days after Christmas, I play with various Snapchat filters. I love how I look with most of them, not feeling horribly ugly for once. I notice that they aren't simply disguising blemishes and zits, but are explicitly feminizing the face: shrinking the nose, softening the jawline, etc.

May 2019 - "I don't really feel like I'm trans but sometimes I feel like I would be more comfortable in a female body, but like... I don't feel any real desire to change anything about my gender expression or use different pronouns. Maybe I should just stop falling in love with lesbians and I'd probably stop thinking about it."

October 2019 - "I wish I was a lady sort of. Not really. I dunno. I just wish I was a lesbian really." [...] "It's more of a longing than feeling like something is wrong. I have this image of sitting on the couch with pink pajama pants on with long hair and a chest and hips and it feels weirdly right but also... I dunno."

July 2020 - beaches. Envy. Seeing cute girls in swimsuits and being attracted to them, sure, but far more than that wishing that I could be them. "What I really wanted was to have boobs and be wearing a hot bikini. You know. The beach. And to have no body hair. Or my shoulders, they're too broad. And to have hips. That probably is not a very cis thing to want." Also thinking something more akin to bigender: "what I really want is to just be able to snap my fingers and just be able to go back and forth."

August 2020 - discussing gender euphoria with a friend. "The main, recurring image that comes to mind is like sitting on the couch some morning with a mug of coffee wearing just a really long white t shirt with a female body."

December 2020 - a thread comes up on my Twitter feed about trans eggs always picking "opposite" gender characters in video games. I've been doing this since at least 2016 (with Fallout 4) and probably before that.

Summer 2021 - beaches. Whistling Kettle summer dress envy.

December 2021 - first time I remember feeling "mirror horror" - brushing my teeth in the dark because something was unidentifiably **wrong** about the version of me looking back. Sometimes it felt totally abstract and without cause, and sometimes it was identifiably because I wanted to see a girl looking back and couldn't. In the women's section of a clothing store, I see various sweaters and cardigans that make my heart ache out of longing.

May 2022 - a life-changing breakup after 5 years together. On the last or second-to-last night before moving out, one of the final times (as of writing) that we saw each other, I choke out a "I don't think I'm cis, and it was killing me that I never told you." Afterwards I write in my journal that I don't understand exactly why I did this, that certainly with everything going on it was not the ideal time, but that I feel like a weight has been lifted off of me.

July 2022 - sat and cried in the shower about not being a girl. Drunk at a bar one night a week later, heart-pounding, I asked 3 friends there to start using they/them for me. They were all accepting and wonderful. One of them immediately asked if I wanted to change my name and I froze in fear; I think a part of me absolutely knew the answer was yes, that I had never liked my name, but it felt too real, too much, and besides I hadn't even thought about names yet. My plan was to just tell this group about changing my pronouns, but it felt so good that within 72 hours I had asked nearly everyone I talked to regularly to make this change.

Aug 2022 - a friend is concerned about me and my tendencies towards depression and suicidal ideation after my breakup. I assure her that I have no intention of harming myself, which is true. The ideas are all abstract and besides my Schopenhauerian will-to-live is much too strong for me to take my own life. While explaining this, my mind forms the thought: "Besides, if I were going to kill myself, it would be because I wasn't born a girl, not because of some breakup." I don't say this, but my brain catches, halts, scratches like a record when the thought forms. I realize that there is a great deal of truth to it.

November 2022 - for the first time I feel dysphoria about my Adam's apple when looking at my profile in the mirror. I go home for Thanksgiving and while there I ask one of my oldest friends, who is a trans man, how he *knew*, how he was certain. He tells me it's hard to say for sure, but there was simply a point where it dawned on him that if he didn't transition he was going to die. He looks at me and says "Why do you ask?" I pause and search and reply, "Why do you think?"

December 2022 - the name Allie comes to me while I am writing a song and I can't let it go or get it out of my head. Something about it just feels right. I spend a week or two straight unable to think about anything besides my gender. It feels like my brain is on fire, and I explicitly comment as such to a few friends and to my therapist. I actively try to think about other things but my mind keeps wandering back to it. I get sick and joke that "I thought about gender so hard I gave myself a sinus infection." I buy foundation and concealer to cover up acne and my five-o'-clock shadow. At Christmas my mom calls me "he" and says something to my sister about "your brother" and a voice in my head wants to cry out that this is wrong, but I can't bring myself to say anything. I reach out to every trans woman I know, and several I don't, asking how they knew. Most tell me that they just *did*, and all of them tell me they knew in middle school or earlier, even the ones who didn't begin to transition until much, much later in life. At the very least they knew something was wrong, even if they didn't have the words and the language for it yet. I email two HRT clinics and am told that I will be put on a wait list.

January 2023 - On an impulse, I get my ears pierced because I believe it will help me look more feminine. I ask one friend online to start calling me Allie, and it feels good. I ask a few more, then a Discord server, and then I start to ask a few friends that I actually see in-person (although I never ask in-person, always through text). I book a laser hair removal session for my chest and go to my first appointment. It hurts.

February 2023 - an HRT clinic emails me back and I book an appointment for March. I am full of fear, feeling more strongly than I have in months that maybe I could keep living as a boy and be fine with it and that I am not ready for what I could be committing to. While getting ready to go out with a friend, I put on a headband and mascara and watch as, in the mirror, before my eyes, my perception changes from seeing someone pretty to seeing my own, ugly, male face behind gaudy makeup and I have to look away out of disgust. A voice inside of me says to stop trying now before you make anything worse than it already is, just go back to how you were surviving before.

description: What can I even say about a game that already says so much itself?
---

Like many others before me, I find myself compelled to write about Disco Elysium every time I play it (which is four or five times now). But it's shockingly difficult to figure out what to even say. Every time I start to write, I find that I am just recounting the story or writing an explainer on the lore in the hopes that re-telling it can get *something* about it across, something that seems ineffable.

As I attempt to get my thoughts out, be warned: I am not going to mark or avoid spoilers.

The lightning summary of Disco Elysium is this: you are a Detective who has woken up in a room that is not yours with a killer hangover, your clothes scattered around the room, and--depending on your choices--no memory of what led you here. You stumble your way down the stairs (if you don't die trying to grab your Hideous Necktie off the ceiling fan--which is exactly what happened to me on my first playthrough, in possibly the quickest Game Over I've ever hit) and meet Kim Kitsuragi, your straight-man partner who is here to help. He explains that you are here to solve the mystery of The Hanged Man who is currently decomposing in the courtyard behind the cafeteria-hostel where you woke up. Hilarity (among many other emotions) ensues. As you progress, you discover more about this presque-réaliste world and the characters that inhabit it, working your way through mind-numbingly large dialog trees. You will learn about the failed Communist revolution, the international coalition keeping the city under its boot, the Union strike, the rise and fall of disco, the don't-call-them-Crown corporations---sorry, "indotribes"--that control nearly all the world's commerce, and the mystical Pale which separates the world's continents and causes those that cross it to lose their memory and their minds. In the end, after cycling through a spinning carousel of suspects, you learn that the murder was committed not by any of these forces you've encountered throughout the bulk of the story, but by an aging Communist deserter who has lost his mind in his isolation. 

And then you have an in-depth philosophical conversation with a giant bug.

There are a few key components to Disco Elysium that make it stick in my head like glue: the depth of the "historical" lore of the world and its politics, the roundness of the characters, the perfectly executed quasi-realism of the city of Revachol, and how all of this melds perfectly with the soundtrack and the art and the gameplay. In this first post, I'll primarily focus on the lore and politics. Even though I'll be using examples, I'll try to refrain from simply recounting the game.

The lore of Disco Elysium is immense. Of the million or so words that the game contains, surely no more than half are directly related to the actual (purported) main plot of the murder mystery. The other half (at least) of those million words must be characters explaining the history and state of the world to our Detective. The extent to which this is fleshed out is hard to convey; in my fifth playthrough, I was still discovering new pieces of information I hadn't learned before. Through the conversations the Detective engages in and books he reads, we are able to learn about the ancient discovery of intercontinental travel, the colonization of the newly discovered land, the now-50-year-old Communist revolution which overthrew the ~~~tsar~~~ suzerain, and the international coalition which crushed the revolution. All of these historical events are enriched by a rich cast of historical characters who are nearly as fleshed out as the live characters we meet throughout the game. 

Disco Elysium manages to make learning about history exciting by tying it directly into the game itself. There are four core ideologies in the game:
* Fascism, for those who long for a return to the days of the suzerain when men were men, women stayed at home, and foreigners and immigrants didn't exist
* Communism, for those who wish for a better world where people are equal, workers rights are protected, the natural world is respected, etc (even if this does mean a couple landowners might have to be beheaded along the way; sometimes that's the price you pay for freedom)
* Ultraliberalism, for those who believe in the Free Market above all else, that state intervention in the economy is the ultimate evil, regulations are destructive, and privitization is the way to utopia
* Moralism, for those who believe in "the center" and "promoting progress through small, incremental changes." The game describes it as such: "_Moralists don't really **have** beliefs. Sometimes they stumble on one, like on a child's toy left on the carpet. The toy must be put away immediately. And the child reprimanded._"

The believers in these ideologies, these parties of the revolution and its following events, are still active in some form in the "present day" of the game. The details of the events you hear will depend on who you are talking to, just as you would expect in real life. If you ask a Communist about the day the Coalition attacked, you will be told about the pure evil of capital indescriminately shelling Revachol to put down the revolution; if you ask a member of the Coalition (a Moralist), they will tell you that they "stopped the disaster of the Revolution" and highlight the economic growth Revachol experienced (several years, and deeply unevenly) afterwards.

The game largely depicts fascism as irredeemably evil. Most of the fascist characters the player encounters are racist almost to the point of absurdity. The main exception to this is Rene, The Old Soldier, who fought for the suzerain all those decades ago. Rene is an angry, bitter old man who pines over his lost cause and blames the Communists and, to a lesser extent, the Moralists for the desperate situation Revachol (and especially Martinaise, the poverty-stricken neighborhood in which the game takes place) finds itself in. Through the dialog choices offered to the player, the game admits a certain pride to Rene and some modicum of respect for his dedication and service. This is not the same as ceding any ground on his beliefs, however.

There are very few ultraliberals found in Martinaise. Of course, hyper capitalists are rarely drawn towards locales which force them to confront the outcome of the free market for those who do not end up on top. The most prominent ultraliberal the player can interact with is Joyce Messier, a negotiation rep for the Wild Pines Group, the company against which the strike is occurring. Somewhat sinisterly on the surface, Joyce is portrayed as one of the kindest and most likable characters in the entire game. [[More here]]

On the surface, Moralism sounds nice enough. Even the name is quite pleasant. Who could argue with being moral? Your partner Kim, everyone's favorite character, is (or was, in his 20s) a Moralist! However, when you dig into the subtext (and when you unlock certain Thoughts and conversations), you discover the game holds more disdain for Moralism and centrism than just about any other ideology. Moralists are responsible for the annihilation of Martinaise, and the decision to not rebuild it for to serve as a reminder against any who would start a new revolution. They are responsible for the massacre of the Communists and, it is implied, a large part of the civilian population of Revachol as well during the "liberation." They are without belief and without conviction; maintaining the status quo of capitalism and "democratic principles" is their only priority. Nevermind that Revachol has no elected government; nevermind the poverty and environmental destruction; nevermind that Coalition warships are still hovering over the city 50 years after the end of the war. Centrism is what allows all of this to happen. It is what turns a blind eye to war crimes committed by the victor.

Finally, we come to Communism, which in the world of Disco Elysium has experienced much the same catastrophic failure as it has in our own. Very few Communists are encountered in the world of Disco Elysium. Joyce states that this is because the Coalition wiped them all out. Besides the literal meaning--the millions of dead revolutionaries who were all "shot in the head"--the constant reminders of the Commune's failure make it impossible to rebuild revolutionary ideals. In a sense, this is Timothy Snyder's "Politics of Inevitability" which capitalism and Western liberalism have established in our world as well: “a sense that the future is just more of the present, that the laws of progress are known, that there are no alternatives, and therefore nothing really to be done.” There are no Communists left in Martinaise because the Coalition has established there are no alternatives for Moralism and incrementalism.

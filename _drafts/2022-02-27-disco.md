description: What can I even say about a game that already says so much itself?
---

Like many others before me, I find myself compelled to write about Disco Elysium every time I play it (which is four or five times now). But it's shockingly difficult to figure out what to even say. Every time I start to write, I find that I am just recounting the story or writing an explainer on the lore in the hopes that re-telling it can get *something* about it across, something that seems ineffable.

As I attempt to get my thoughts out, be warned: I am not going to mark or avoid spoilers.

The lightning summary of Disco Elysium is this: you are a Detective who has woken up in a room that is not yours with a killer hangover, your clothes scattered around the room, and--depending on your choices--no memory of what led you here. You stumble your way down the stairs (if you don't die trying to grab your Hideous Necktie off the ceiling fan--which is exactly what happened to me on my first playthrough, in possibly the quickest Game Over I've ever hit) and meet Kim Kitsuragi, your straight-man partner who is here to help. He explains that you are here to solve the mystery of The Hanged Man who is currently decomposing in the courtyard behind the cafeteria-hostel where you woke up. Hilarity (among many other emotions) ensues. As you progress, you discover more about this presque-r√©aliste world and the characters that inhabit it, working your way through mind-numbingly large dialog trees. You will learn about the failed Communist revolution, the international coalition keeping the city under its boot, the Union strike, the rise and fall of disco, the don't-call-them-Crown corporations---sorry, "indotribes"--that control nearly all the world's commerce, and the mystical Pale which separates the world's continents and causes those that cross it to lose their memory and their minds. In the end, after cycling through a spinning carousel of suspects, you learn that the murder was committed not by any of these forces you've encountered throughout the bulk of the story, but by an aging Communist deserter who has lost his mind in his isolation. 

And then you have an in-depth philosophical conversation with a giant bug.

There are a few key components to Disco Elysium that make it stick in my head like glue: the depth of the "historical" lore of the world and its politics, the roundness of the characters, the perfectly executed quasi-realism of the city of Revachol, and how all of this melds perfectly with the soundtrack and the art and the gameplay.

The lore of Disco Elysium is immense. Of the million or so words that the game contains, surely no more than half are directly related to the actual (purported) main plot of the murder mystery. At least half of those million words must be characters explaining the history and state of the world to our Detective.
